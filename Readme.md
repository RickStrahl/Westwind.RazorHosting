#### Hosting the Razor Runtime outside of ASP.NET MVC/WebPages

<img src="razorhosting.png" height="200" style="height: 200px" />


This library wraps the .NET Razor engine for use as a **standalone template engine outside of ASP.NET MVC**. Using this library you can host the Razor engine in desktop, console, service or any kind of full framework .NET application and render pages from strings or the file system.

### Features
* Standalone Razor Template Rendering
* Use in desktop, console, service or even Web applications
* No dependencies on ASP.NET or MVC
* Render templates from string content
* Render templates from a folder structure
* Support for Partial Pages and Layout Pages (FolderHostContainer)
* Provides HostContainers for template caching and change detection
* Support for execution in separate AppDomain

### Use Cases
* Creating HTML output in desktop applications
* Creating text merge documents: Email confirmations, merge letters etc.
* Creating HTML reports
* Code and template generation
* Dynamic code execution (Razor Templates can execute arbitrary code after all)

> #### Similar to MVC Razor but not MVC Razor!
> The RazorHosting engine provides core templating functionality of the raw Razor sytnax engine. This means that all C# language features and all of Razor's basic expression and logic parsing features work.
>
> It **does not** provide full parity with either the MVC or WebPages implementations however, since both of these engines are closely tied to ASP.NET semantics. Things like HTML and URL Helpers, Sections, Partials and Layout pages are not natively supported by Razor. **Partials, Helpers and Layout pages are supported only in the `RazorFolderHost` implementation of this library**.
>
> RazorHosting only supports C# - there's no support for Visual Basic.

### Installation
The easiest way to install is via NuGet:

```
install-package westwind.razorhosting
```

The package requires .NET 4.5 or later.

### Basic Concepts
This Razor Host library provides two distinct hosting models:

* **Raw Razor Engine**  
A very easy to use string template function. Useful for very simple one off template rendering from strings, but not recommended for repeated rendering of the same templates.

* **Razor Host Containers**   
A wrapper around the base Razor Engine that provides cached templates, serving templates from a folder hierarchy (like ASP.NET) and optionally loading templates in a separate AppDomain. The `RazorFolderHostContainer` container provides support for **Partials** and **Layout** pages.

For real world applications you almost always want to use a Host Container.

### Simple RazorEngine Usage
RazorEngine is the base template parsing engine. It's very easy to use but provides no internal caching or fixup of templates although you can manually manage this easily.

To execute a template:

```c#
string template = @"Hello World @Model.Name. Time is: @DateTime.Now";
var host = new RazorEngine();
string result = host.RenderTemplate(template,new { Name="Joe Doe" });
```

You can also create a template, compile it and then cache it so you can reuse it later:

```c#
string template = @"Hello World @Model.Name. Time is: @DateTime.Now";
var host = new RazorEngine<RazorTemplateBase>();
host.AddAssembly("System.Data.dll");  // add any assemblies you need in templates            
    
string compiledId = host.CompileTemplate(template);    
string result = host.RenderTemplateFromAssembly(compiledId,
                            new Person() { Name = "Joe Doe" });
...

// Run again later without recompilation
string result = host.RenderTemplateFromAssembly(compiledId,
                            new Person() { Name = "Rick Strahl" });
```

The latter example lets you capture a compilation id which points to a cached template assembly in the current RazorEngine instance. Running an already compiled template is considerably faster and saves resources as no new assembly is created each time you run the same template.

> #### Caching is Important
> Razor compiles every template into code and compiles the template into an assembly. Without caching, templates are constantly recreated and new assemblies are created which wastes resources. Since assemblies can't unload this basically means you have a memory leak. Cache your templates either as described above, or use a host container which automatically cache and detect changes templates in temlates.

### Model Data
All templates include a `Model` property and the `RenderTemplate()` has a `model` parameter that you can pass to the template. By default models are of type `dynamic`, but the model can also be explicitly typed by using the Razor `@inherits` tag:

```html
@inherits RazorTemplateBase<RazorHostingTests.Person>
<h3>Hello @Model.Firstname.</h3>
```

you can also use the more familiar `@model` tag:

```html
@model RazorHostingTests.Person
<h3>Hello @Model.Firstname.</h3>
```

but you'll sacrifice IntelliSense in Visual Studio - IntelliSense only works with the `@inherits` syntax. If no `@model` or `@inherits` is specified, the Model is assumed to be of type `dynamic`.

### Using Host Containers
Host Containers wrap the basic `RazorEngine` by providing automatic caching for templates,  template change detection and the ability to optionally run the Razor templates in a separate AppDomain.

There are two provided HostContainers that address the most common use cases:

* **RazorStringHostContainer**  
Renders templates from strings. Templates are cached based on the template's text.

* **RazorFolderHostContainer**  
Renders templates from the file system by pointing at a template on disk. Templates are cached based on file timestamps. Folder hosted templates support Partial Layout and Layout pages.

HostContainers are meant to be **reused**, so you typically instantiate it once, then hang on to the reference and reuse it for subsequent requests. The template cache is associated with an instance so in order to get the caching benefit the instance needs to stay alive.

### A better Approach - Host Container and Application Wrapper
Before we look closer at HostContainers, here's a recommended approach for creating an application ready handler that makes it easy to render templates with a single line of code. I like to wrap all template rendering logic into an application specific static class that cachese the host container.

The following uses the `RazorFolderHostContainer` which uses disk based templates out of a root folder. Here's what this small class looks like:

```cs
public class AppTemplates
{
    public static RazorFolderHostContainer RazorHost { get; set; }
    
    public static string RenderTemplate(string template, object model, out string error)
    {
        if (RazorHost == null)
            StartRazorHost();        
        
        string result = RazorHost.RenderTemplate(template,model);
        if (result == null)
            error = RazorHost.ErrorMessage;
            
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void StartRazorHost()
    {
        var host = new RazorFolderHostContainer() 
        {
            // *** Set your Folder Path here - physical or relative ***
            TemplatePath = Path.GetFullPath(@".\templates\"),
            // *** Path to the Assembly path of your application
            BaseBinaryFolder = Environment.CurrentDirectory
        };
        
        // Add any assemblies that are referenced in your templates
        host.AddAssemblyFromType(typeof(Person));
        host.AddAssemblyFromType(typeof(AppConfiguration));
        
  
        // Always must start the host
        host.Start();
        
        RazorHost = host;
    }
    
    public static void StopRazorHost()
    {
        RazorHost?.Stop();
    }
}
```

This consolidates all the logic needed to load, shut down and render templates using the RazorHost. Now you can use a single line to render any template out of the folder structure.

```cs
AppTemplates.RenderTemplate("~/header.cshtml",topic, out string error);
```

This method will start the host if it's not loaded and then render the template.

The same approach can be used with the `StringHostContainer` with slightly different configuration.

### RazorStringHostContainer
StringHostContainer executes templates from string, but caches the compiled templates based on the template's content. IOW, running the same exact template twice will automatically compile on the first run, and use the cached version on the second and subsequent runs. As long as the the template string is identical the cached assembly is used.

To run a String Template Host:

```c#
var host = new RazorStringHostContainer();
//host.UseAppDomain = true; 
        
// add model assembly - ie. this assembly
host.AddAssemblyFromType(this);
host.AddAssembly("System.Data.dll");
    
// must start the host container
host.Start();
              
// Create a model to pass in
Person person = new Person()
{
    Name = "Rick",
    Company = "West Wind",
    Entered = DateTime.Now,
    Address = new Address()
    {
        Street = "32 Kaiea",
        City = "Paia"
    }
};

// create a template to render
string template = @"@inherits Westwind.RazorTemplateBase<RazorHostingTests.Person>
<b>@Model.Name of @Model.Company entered on @Model.Entered";
    
// Render the actual template and pass the model
string result = host.RenderTemplate(string,person);
    	
Console.WriteLine(result);
Console.WriteLine("---");
Console.WriteLine(host.Engine.LastGeneratedCode);

if (result == null)
    Assert.Fail(host.ErrorMessage);

// shut down the host            
host.Stop();

// Hosts also implement IDisposable to Stop
host.Dispose();  
```

With a host container you typically will run many requests between the Start() and Stop() operations.

### RazorFolderHostContainer
The RazorFolderHostContainer can be used to point to a folder on disk and treat it like a virtual directory for rendering templates from disk. Templates are loaded based on a virtual path (`~/page.cshtml` and `~/sub/page.cshtml`) relative to the base folder, and support usage for subpages via `@RenderPartial()` and layout pages via the `Layout` property. The template loading behavior is similar to ASP.NET MVC's path based View handling.

To run folder host templates:

```c#
var host = new RazorFolderHostContainer();

// must specify the base path ('Virtual' root path) for templates
host.TemplatePath = Path.GetFullPath("..\\..\\FileTemplates\\");

// point at the folder where dependent assemblies can be found
// this applies only to separate AppDomain hosting
host.BaseBinaryFolder = Environment.CurrentDirectory;

// add model assembly - ie. this assembly
host.AddAssemblyFromType(typeof(Person));

host.UseAppDomain = true;
//host.Configuration.CompileToMemory = true;
//host.Configuration.TempAssemblyPath = Environment.CurrentDirectory;

// Always must start the host
host.Start();

// create a model to pass
Person person = new Person()
{
	Name = "Rick",
	Company = "West Wind",
	Entered = DateTime.Now,
	Address = new Address()
	{
		Street = "32 Kaiea",
		City = "Paia"
	}
};

// render a template and pass the model
string result = host.RenderTemplate("~/HelloWorld.cshtml", person);

Console.WriteLine(result);
Console.WriteLine("---");
Console.WriteLine(host.Engine.LastGeneratedCode);

host.Stop();

if (result == null)
	Assert.Fail(host.ErrorMessage);

Assert.IsTrue(result.Contains("West Wind"));
```
	   
where the template might look like this:

```html
@inherits RazorTemplateFolderHost<RazorHostingTests.Person>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>    
    @RenderPartial("~/Header_Partial.cshtml",Model)

	@Model.Name @Model.Company @Model.Address.City @Model.Entered 
    
	@for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	{
		Response.WriteLine(i + ".");
	}  

	You can also render nested templates from string
	@RenderTemplate("Child Template rendered from String. Name: @Model.Name",Model) 
</body>
</html>
```

### Rendering Layout Pages
You can also use Layout pages with the `RazorFolderHostContainer` by specifying the `Layout` property in your view/template. Layout pages are like master pages that render around a content page and can be reused to provide a common shell. Layout pages in turn can also contain template tags and call out to Partial pages.

To specify a Layout page, set the Layout property in your code.

```html
@inherits Westwind.RazorHosting.RazorTemplateFolderHost<RazorHostingTests.Person>
@{
    Layout = "~/_Layout.cshtml"
}
<h3>Hello @Model.Firstname</h3>
<p>
this is my page content rendered at @DateTime.Now.
</p>
```

The View Page then:

```html
@inherits Westwind.RazorHosting.RazorTemplateFolderHost<RazorHostingTests.Person>

<h1>Layout Page Header</h1>
<hr />

@RenderBody()

<hr/>
&copy; West Wind Technologies, 2010-@DateTime.Now.Year
```

Note that you should use the same model your are passing to the content page as a parameter in the layout page - if you plan on accessing model content.


### Error Handling in Host Containers
Host containers tend to render to string values and will return **null** on error. You can also check the `LastException` property for non `null` to check for the presence of an error.

The following demonstrates typical host error logic:

```cs
string result = host.RenderTemplate("~/RuntimeError.cshtml", person);

Assert.IsNull(result, "result should be null on error");
Console.WriteLine(host.ErrorMessage);  // simple message

Assert.IsNotNull(host.LastException, "Last exception should be set");

Console.WriteLine("---"); 
Console.WriteLine(host.LastException.Message);
Console.WriteLine(host.LastException.ActiveTemplate); // only in RazorFolderHost
//Console.WriteLine(host.LastException.GeneratedSourceCode);
Console.WriteLine("---");

// Render HTML output of the error
// For RazorFolderHost also renders the template source code and line numbers
Console.WriteLine(host.RenderHtmlErrorPage());
```            
            




### Html Helpers
You can also use HTML Helpers in your Razor views:

```html
@helper WriteBlockText(string text)
{
    <b>*** @text ***</b>
}

Helper output: @WriteBlockText("Help me!");
```



### Running in a separate AppDomain with UseAppDomain
Note that you can choose to host the container in a separate AppDomain by using:

```c#
host.UseAppDomain = true;
```

If you do, make sure any models passed into the host for rendering are marked `[Serializable]` or inherit from `MarshalByRefObject`. Due to these limitations you have to ensure that all parameters and dependent members can be serialized when passing parameters from your application to the RazorEngine via AppDomains.

Using an AppDomain is useful when loading lots of templates and allows for unloading the engine to reduce memory usage. It also helps isolate template code from the rest of your application for security purposes, since Razor templates essentially can execute any code in the context of the host.

### Caching the Host Container in a Static or Singleton
The easiest way to cache a host container is via static variable declared in a relevant location of your application.

For example you can do this:

```cs
public class AppUtils 
{
    public static RazorFolderHostContainer RazorHost { get; set; }
    ...
}
```

and then to use it:

```cs
RazorFolderHostContainer host;

if (AppUtils.RazorHost == null)
{
    var host = new RazorFolderHostContainer();
    // ... set up the host
    AppUtils.RazorHost = host;
}

AppUtils.RenderTemplate("~/topic.cshtml",topic);
```
### Put it all together: Application Integration
I like to wrap all template rendering logic into an application specific static class so I cache the host container and not have to worry about loading the container.

Here's what this small class looks like:

```cs
public class AppTemplates
{
    public static RazorFolderHostContainer RazorHost { get; set; }
    
    public static string RenderTemplate(string template, object model, out error)
    {
        if (RazorHost == null)
            StartRazorHost();        
        
        string result = RazorHost.RenderTemplate(template,model);
        if (result == null)
            error = RazorHost.ErrorMessage;
            
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void StartRazorHost()
    {
        var host = new RazorFolderHostContainer() 
        {
            // *** Set your Folder Path here - physical or relative ***
            TemplatePath = Path.GetFullPath(@".\templates\"),
            BaseBinaryFolder = Environment.CurrentDirectory
        };
        host.AddAssemblyFromType(typeof(Person));
        host.AddAssemblyFromType(this.GetType());
  
        // Always must start the host
        host.Start();
        
        RazorHost = host;
    }
    
    public static void StopRazorHost()
    {
        RazorHost?.Stop();
    }
}
```

This consolidates all the logic needed to load, shut down and render templates using the RazorHost. This reduces the code to render a template to a single line of code now:

```cs
AppTemplates.RenderTemplate("~/header.cshtml",topic);
```

This method will start the host if it's not loaded and then go ahead and render the template.

### Using Latest C# Language Features
The library by default uses the .NET Runtime built in CSharp code provider which supports only C# 5.x. It's possible to use later versions of C# by explicitly adding the new .NET Compiler platform libraries to the host project and explicitly providing the CSharpProvider.  We don't provide this in the box because the Roslyn compiler package is very large (17megs) so we provide an opt-in mechanism that lets you decide if you need the newer language features and extra deployment requirements for your host application.

To add C# 7.x support:

* Add `Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform.CSharpCodeProvider` Nuget Package to your Project
* Add `<system.codedom>` section to host app's app.config
* Provide CSharpCodeProvider to RazorEngine or HostContainer

Here are the required `app.config` settings that ensures that the compiler binaries can be found:

```xml
<configuration>
	<appSettings>
		<add key="aspnet:RoslynCompilerLocation" value="roslyn"/>
	</appSettings>
	<system.codedom>
		<compilers>
			<compiler language="c#;cs;csharp" extension=".cs"
				type="Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform.CSharpCodeProvider, Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35"
				warningLevel="4" compilerOptions="/langversion:default /nowarn:1659;1699;1701"/>
			<compiler language="vb;vbs;visualbasic;vbscript" extension=".vb"
				type="Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform.VBCodeProvider, Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35"
				warningLevel="4" compilerOptions="/langversion:default /nowarn:41008 /define:_MYTYPE=\&quot;Web\&quot; /optionInfer+"/>
		</compilers>
	</system.codedom>
</configuration>
```

To use the compiler with your Razor code use one of the following approaches to pass the `CSharpCodeProvider`:

##### Basic RazorEngine
```cs
var cs = new Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform.CSharpCodeProvider()
var engine = new RazorEngine(cs);
```

##### Using a HostContainer
```cs
var host = new RazorFolderHostContainer();
host.CodeProvider = new Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform.CSharpCodeProvider();
```

> #### Does not work with Out of Process Hosting
> This approach of providing the CSharp code provider does not work with AppDomain loading of the Razor engine in host containers. For AppDomain loaded instances only the stock C# 5 provider is used.
